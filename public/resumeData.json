    "bio":"Hello there! I am a Quantitative Researcher at Worldquant in the Mumbai office (India). I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. I am highly interested in the fields related to Quantitative Research/Analysis, Applications of ML/AI, Algorithms, Cybersecurity and Blockchains. Before starting as a full-time researcher at Worldquant, I completed three internships where I gained decent experience and exposure in the fields of Quantitative Trading (Quadeye), Software Development (Intel & C3i), ML (Intel), and Blockchains (C3i). When I am not working, I like to indulge in sports : I play Cricket, Football, Table Tennis, Hockey, Kabaddi and Badminton. In my free time, I like to read books as well as listen to music. I try to learn something new from everyone I meet and I am really interested in having conversations related to modern technology, development, policy-making, books, spirituality, politics, and many more. Feel free to reach out and we can surely have a nice and productive conversation!",
